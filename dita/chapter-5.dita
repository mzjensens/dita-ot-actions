            <title>The Wedding</title>
            <p>With each room of gold he had seen, the king grew more pleased with the millerâ€™s

                lived in a grand palace, surrounded by the luxuries of royal life, and her father no
                longer needed to worry about his livelihood. She had done what seemed impossible,
                and life was peaceful for a time</p>

            <p>Years passed, and eventually, the queen gave birth to her first child, a beautiful
                baby who brought new joy and hope to the palace. She had nearly forgotten about the
                little man and the desperate promise she had made that night in the room of straw.
                Her world now was filled with the sweet joy of her child, and she believed the past
                was behind her. </p>
